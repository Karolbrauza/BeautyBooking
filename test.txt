1. Refining the MVP Scope

Core Features: We'll analyze the feature list and ruthlessly prioritize the absolute essentials for the first release. This ensures a faster build and allows for early user feedback.
Target Audience: We'll get even more specific about your ideal first customer. Knowing their biggest pain points keeps the MVP focused.
Tech Stack Considerations: Based on your skills or potential team, I can suggest technology choices suitable for rapid MVP development.
2. Planning & Wireframing

User Flow: We'll map out the simplest user journeys for both service providers and customers (e.g., profile setup, browsing, booking, payment).
Rough UI Wireframes: I'll help sketch basic layouts, not for beauty, but to visualize the core functionality and spot potential usability issues. There are tools like Balsamiq for this if you prefer.
3. Development Guidance

Tech Recommendations: I can provide more targeted advice on frameworks, libraries, and potential pre-built components based on your tech stack decisions.
Coding Best Practices: I can offer tips on clean code, structuring the project, and comment usage if you'd like.
Problem-Solving: If you hit a snag, describe the issue. I might suggest coding approaches, point you to relevant documentation, or help you debug.
4. Testing and Feedback

Test Cases: I can help you write simple test cases to ensure core functionality works before involving users.
Finding Beta Users: We can discuss strategies to find those initial potential customers in your target niche who'd be willing to test the MVP.
Analyzing Feedback: I can help you structure questions for feedback and make sense of the data you get from early users.
Limitations

I cannot build the app for you: I cannot write the actual code. My role is as a thought partner, advisor, and troubleshooter.
Specifics depend on your tech skills: The level of coding help I can provide depends on your experience.
